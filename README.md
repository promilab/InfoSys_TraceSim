# Paper Repository


### Overview

This directory contains the data collection and analysis material for the Information Systems paper entitled "Graph-based Similarity Measures for the Structural Comparison of Process Traces".

Structure

* Folder [Notebooks](https://github.com/promilab/InfoSys_TraceSim/tree/main/Notebooks): contains the Python notebooks used to evaluate the similarity measures based on Nearest Neighbour, Precision@10, and Triplet for:
    * SynL1-SynL4: synthetic event logs cotaining different structural features - generated with [PLG](https://plg.processmining.it/)
    * EyeT1-EyeT2: eye tracking data collected from an experiment on [process model comprehension](https://github.com/promilab/InfoSysTaskType)
    * PO and Wabo: two real-world event logs published for the [BPI Challenge 2015](https://data.4tu.nl/collections/BPI_Challenge_2015/5065424) and [BPI Challenge 2019](https://data.4tu.nl/articles/dataset/BPI_Challenge_2019/12715853/1).
